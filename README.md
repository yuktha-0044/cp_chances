# Awesome Oppurtunities!

> A curated list of some awesome oppurtunities for programmers.

## 1. ACM-ICPC
The ICPC formerly known as ACM-ICPC (Association for Computing Machinery - International Collegiate Programming Contest) is considered as the "Olympics of Programming Competitions".
It is quite simply, the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world.<br>
<br>The ICPC is a multi-tier, team-based, programming competition. The contest participants come from over 2,000 universities that are spread across 80 countries and six continents.

### Eligibility Criteria:
- Willing and able to compete in the world finals.
- Enrolled in a degree program at an institution (in or outside India) that can sponsor you.
- Competing only for one institution for the calendar year.
- You should not have participated in more than 2 contest finals prior to this attempt.
- You should not have participated in more than 5 contest regionals prior to this attempt.
- You cannot participate in more than 2 teams in the same year.
- You cannot participate at more than 2 regionals in the same year (for Asia region).

### Contest Structure:
The contest consists of two rounds:
- [*ICPC Regionals*](https://icpc.global/regionals) : The regionals are organized by the local universities of different regions spread across the globe. The winners of these 
regional rounds of the contest get to represent the country in the ICPC World Finals. The Asia Regionals in India will be held at 4 sites viz. Amritapuri, Kolkata, Gwalior, and
Kharagpur.
- Every regional contest site gets a "slot," which is an invitation for the team to compete in the World Finals. Typically, all the "slots" are allocated by December 31 every year.
Additional slots may also be allocated based on student and institution participation, geographic coverage, and team performance. A few bonus slots are allocated each year for 
growth, innovation, and hosting. So depending on the number of slots that each regional site gets, that many numbers of top teams it can send to the World Finals.
- Also, each regional site can have multiple rounds to select the best teams amongst those who apply. Typically they have an online contest, out of which selected teams are called
for the onsite contest. These contests happen from the month of October to December.
- [*World Finals*](http://icpc.baylor.edu/worldfinals) : The pick of the crop from every regional site locks horn at the World Finals.:raised_hands:

### Contest Format:
- It is a team contest.
- Each team should have three members and one reserve (3 + 1).
- Each team must be headed by a coach, who must be a university faculty or staff member.
- The coach can head multiple teams
- The contest can have several problems (8 to 10 in general), of varying difficulty levels and mostly being algorithmic in nature.

### Perks:
In terms of prize money, the top team takes home $15,000 along with the ICPC Gold medal. Three other teams getting Gold Medal are awarded $7,500. Each Silver Medal team gets 
$6,000 and each Bronze Medal team is awarded $3,000. Courtesy of the UPE Computer Science Honor Society, the First Solution Award will be $1,500.
For the other solved problems, The First to Solve Award will be $1,200.<br>
And more important than all, the winners also get some super bragging rights and job offers from some of the top software companies in the world!

## 2. Google Code Jam

Code Jam is Google’s longest running global coding competition, where programmers of all levels put their skills to the test. Competitors work their way through a series of online algorithmic puzzles to earn a spot at the World Finals.<br>
Contestants advance through four online-hosted rounds to compete at the annual Code Jam World Finals that is held at a different international Google office each year. Each round brings new challenges, and in the end 25 contestants will have the ultimate chance to put their skills to the test, vying for cash prizes and the coveted championship title at the World Finals.


### Eligibility Criteria:
- Programmers around the world
- You understand and acknowledge the age requirements specified in the [Coding Competitions Terms](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/terms#eligibility).
- You understand and acknowledge that you must be at least the Minimum Age to be eligible to attend the onsite Final Round of the CJ Contest. If your age is not at least the       Minimum Age, you are only eligible to win a t-shirt.

### How it works?

Register and compete in Code Jam’s online qualification round. It lasts 27 hours, but you won’t need that long to earn the round’s qualifying point minimum. Once you do, you’ll advance to online round 1. Google offers three sub-rounds for Round 1, and you can compete in as many as it takes for you to finish in the top 1,500 of any of these rounds.

The top 1,500 from each sub-round move on to compete for a spot in the top 1,000 contestants of online round 2. These top 1,000 contestants advance to online round 3 and earn a limited-edition event t-shirt.

Google will bring the top 25 contestants from Code Jam online round 3 to their onsite World Finals, where they’ll compete for the championship title and a cash prize of $15,000.
(Yayyy!)

And usually the registrations open around March or April every year.

## 3. Facebook Hackercup:
Facebook hacker cup is an annual algorithmic programming contest organized by Facebook. Be it students, professionals or experts it attracts numerous programming enthusiasts from all around the globe. Top contenders are eligible for the interview call from Facebook for Software Developer role.<br>
Facebook Hacker cup is particularly known for its different environment used for Judging and the variety of problems. It is conducted in many rounds where the difficulty of algorithmic challenges keep on increasing.

### Contest structure:
- *Qualification round*: Is the easiest round in which at least 1 problem needs to be solved successfully in order to advance in the next round. This round lasts for 72 hours.
- *Round 1* : The selected candidates participate in round 1 which lasts for 24 hours and must gain at least certain number of points ( decided accordingly every year) to qualify for the round 2. This round is fairly difficult than the qualification round.

Onsite Final: Top 25 participants from all over the globe compete for winning the title and trophy of Facebook hacker cup at its headquarters. Problems are quite challenging and are good enough to make the contestants sweat head to toe.<br>
<br>And the 1st person on the leader board bags the title and basks in glory.:fire:

### How it works?
The judging format of Facebook hacker cup is quite different from other annual programming contests like ACM-ICPC or IOI.

- When the contest begins users are required to login in the website.
- After logging in they are presented with the problem set. After you think you have solved a problem and sure about its correctness, you have to download an input test file.
- As soon as the input test file is downloaded a timer of 6 minutes commences and in that window of time you are required to run the input test file over your code and form a test file. Within 6 minutes you need to submit both the code and the output text file.
- You can submitted more than once and only the last correct submission will be used for evaluation.
- Once the timer expires you will be unable to submit the solution for that problem again. Time penalty is the sum of submission times of a problem.

### Perks : (May vary year to year)
The 25 finalists will receive the following prizes (in USD):
- 1st: $20,000
- 2nd: $10,000
- 3rd: $5,000
- 4th: $3,000
- 5th: $1,000
- 6th - 10th: $500
- 11th - 15th: $300
- 16th - 25th: $200

The qualification round customarily takes place around July or August every year.
