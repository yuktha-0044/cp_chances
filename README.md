# Awesome Oppurtunities!

> A curated list of some awesome oppurtunities for programmers.

## 1. ACM-ICPC
The ICPC formerly known as ACM-ICPC (Association for Computing Machinery - International Collegiate Programming Contest) is considered as the "Olympics of Programming Competitions".
It is quite simply, the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world.<br>
<br>The ICPC is a multi-tier, team-based, programming competition. The contest participants come from over 2,000 universities that are spread across 80 countries and six continents.

### Contest Structure:
The contest consists of two rounds:
- [*ICPC Regionals*](https://icpc.global/regionals) : The regionals are organized by the local universities of different regions spread across the globe. The winners of these 
regional rounds of the contest get to represent the country in the ICPC World Finals. The Asia Regionals in India will be held at 4 sites viz. Amritapuri, Kolkata, Gwalior, and
Kharagpur.
- Every regional contest site gets a "slot," which is an invitation for the team to compete in the World Finals. Typically, all the "slots" are allocated by December 31 every year.
Additional slots may also be allocated based on student and institution participation, geographic coverage, and team performance. A few bonus slots are allocated each year for 
growth, innovation, and hosting. So depending on the number of slots that each regional site gets, that many numbers of top teams it can send to the World Finals.
- Also, each regional site can have multiple rounds to select the best teams amongst those who apply. Typically they have an online contest, out of which selected teams are called
for the onsite contest. These contests happen from the month of October to December.
